For Assignment:

    - New Level(s)
        -- "Hard Mode" - full 26 button layout
            --- really tricky after level 20 or so
        -- Speed up every 5 levels
            --- "Speeding Up!!!" animation, -15% playback delay
    
    - Guidance
        -- modal on load page
        -- "show don't tell"
            --- gif demonstration

    - update user experience
        -- button feedback
        -- tweaked timing
        -- neon animation


    - AI usage
        -- styling for input/label elements
            --- was having difficulty finding good examples otherwise
        -- game.js - "developing some functions"
            --- asking if my logic was sound, tutor-eqsue
            --- quicker understanding of mdn/w3 documentaion
            --- looking at skeleton functions if I had no reference
            --- bugfixes for stupid errors that aren't clicking

        -- I usually keep inline-suggestions off, sometimes use for syntax

    



Notes: 

    - QWERTY layout is side effect of wanting keyboard integration
        -- i.e. press q or click q-btn does the same thing
        -- couldn't figure it out with JQuery
            --- maybe key.js?
            --- outside of assignment scope

    - playbackSequence() - wanted to draw lines from button to button
        -- changes memory to shape recognition
        -- couldn't figure it out
            -- outside of assignment scope

    - layout is small on small vertical screens
